                    This is a very easy recipe of tomato soup that can be made in 30 minutes if you're a kitchen pro,
                    but if you are a regular Joe like me it will take you close to an hour. Nevertheless, it is <em>really</em>
                    tasty and goes well with a grilled cheese sandwich.
