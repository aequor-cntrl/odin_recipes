# odin_recipes
This is a very simple website that houses links to several recipes. For now, this project is entirely HTML, but it will be revisited to add CSS later. Once it is done, it should demonstrate that I know how to create an HTML boilerplate without the help of an IDE, work with text, create lists, links and images and craft useful commit messages.
